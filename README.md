# GXHTC3 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
This is a library for the GXHTC3 Digital Humidity + Temp sensor.

The GXHTC3 seems to be a clone of the SHTC3 sensor. It implements the same command set, but the ID given for identification is different.
It is code-compatible with the Adafruit SHTC3 library. Thanks to Adafruit for providing the open-source code for this project.

Tested on: RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico).
Requires Adafruit BusIO and Unified Sensor.
